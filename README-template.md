## Overview

The challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. This QR component has no function yet. The challenge was set as a visual component challenge.

## My process
 
This process was straight forward. First I added all the general styling such as font-size and family. Then I went about setting the width of the component along with the alignment so that it would open on Web and mobile and be identicle. Finally I played around with the margins, padding and border-radius until I was satisfied with the outcome. 

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS 


### What I learned

I learned how look at a design and style guide and put together a component which looks almost exactly the same. I learned how to visualise my process of work clearly for the first time. I was able to build it in my mind first, then put it together. 


### Continued development

I want to focus more on mastering more complex projects to improve my knowledge CSS use. Mastering flex and grid are my goals for now.
